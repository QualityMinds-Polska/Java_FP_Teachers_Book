# Teacher's guide for the "Introduction to Functional Programming in Java" worksheet

This repo contains examples I was using during the workshop.\

Here is the link to the worksheet (for students):\
https://github.com/QualityMinds-Polska/JavaFP

I was sharing worksheet (from the `JavaFP` repo)
and asking students to work themselves and then to tell me how to fill the gaps.\

Code from this repo was used as a backup for me (to keep the pace of the workshop) and was not shared with students.

### I am only sharing this because I was specifically asked to do so.

## Warning

`text.md` contains some theory to explain the concepts.\
I used it as a reference for myself, to not forget about some important things.\
It may be not very precise nor should it be used as a reference for students.\
While giving short lecture before a main workshop I relied mainly on my ***own knowledge.***

The text was only a reminder for me,
please don't use it as a reference for students or own learning.\
It is too imprecise and contains too many shortcuts.
